## CVE-2020-10557

AContent v1.4 does not properly protect against dangerous file extensions. In its default intallation, .php7 and .phtml are not included in the "Illegal File Extensions" area of the admin panel. Thus, a user could leverage the web applications open registration, create a course, then use the file manager page to upload a malicious web shell with the .php7 extension. This would allow the malicious user to execute commands on the web server.
